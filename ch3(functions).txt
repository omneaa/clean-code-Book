functions

Do One Thing:
FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING NOT MANY THING IT WILL MAKE THE CODE CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND 

***********************
every function name should describes what the function does.
*************************
if the function make more than one task it should be divided into sections
**********************
Donâ€™t be afraid to make a name long. A long descriptive name is better than a short enigmatic name. A long descriptive name is better than a long descriptive comment.
*******************
Functions should do one thing. Error handing is one thing. Thus, a function that handles errors should do nothing else
